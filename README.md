# React Webpack Boilerplate
This is a simple start for react with webpack.

## How to use
1. Clone repository `git clone git@github.com:sfritsen/react-webpack.git`
2. Install dependancies `npm install`
3. Run one of the scripts below

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm run dev`
This runs the local dev server on port 3000.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
